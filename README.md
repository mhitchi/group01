 ## User Story
 As a web development student
 I want to find events in my area
 Because I don't have a social life.

Busy Bot application helps a user to find events based on location, specific time and event type. Once that information is provided by the user, it only shows the events that he or she can reach on time. Some of the events choices that are available for the user to choose from are comedy shows, theater spectacles, concerts, dance events, sports events and more. To search for the event by a location user needs to specify a city name and state code. Then, Busy Bot filters results and shows only events that are happenning after current time in the provided by a user location. In addition to the events, Busy Bot gets the user’s location and calculates the time that it takes a person to get to the event from his or her location and returns only events that he or she can reach in a timely manner. In addition to search by location, the user has the option of searching for the events by event start time. To start the search by start time user may select the time from the drop-down menu. In this case, Busy Bot will show only those events that are happening after the specified time and only those events that one can make it to in time using users' current time and time to get to the event.  Busy Bot is designed to save the user’s time by filtering and displaying events that user can arrive without being late and without showing events that are irrelevant to the user's choice.
